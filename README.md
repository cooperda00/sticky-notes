# Sticky Notes

The inspiration for this app was to find a way to help my partner keep organised at her workplace (a school). She can leave this open on her screen to easily refer to notes whilst remaining on her feet to attend the students.
Users can add notes, change the theme, add content to notes, change the color of notes and delete notes.
I used react-spring to create the animations, which was the most challenging thing to adapt to.
